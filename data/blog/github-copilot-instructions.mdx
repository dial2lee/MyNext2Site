Since we developers write a lot prompts for AI tools these days,
sometimes we might find ourselves writing manual instructions over and over again for AI agents
to follow our coding style, preferences, and other guidelines.

This is when I find the need to have a set of predefined instructions / rules / guidelines for the AI agents to
follow in every tasks we give them.

Here are my instructions for using **Github Copilot** inside [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <Twemoji emoji="robot" />.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) enabled in your VS Code.
- Enable instructions and prompt files [chat.promptFiles](vscode://settings/chat.promptFiles)
- Enable [github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles) to tell VS Code to apply instructions when generating code.
- Read through the VS Code [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization) for more details.

## General Coding Styles

These are the general instructions for most React / TypeScript projects I work on.

```md:copilot-instructions.md

applyTo: '**'

# Copilot Instructions

<A brief description of the project that you're working on, its purpose, tech stack, or any specific information.>

## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants only (variable named with all camel-cased letters) and prefer let for others.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Always define types for function parameters and return values, try to avoid using `any`
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators for safe property access

## React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS modules for component styling

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
```

## Commit Messages

When generating commit messages, I prefer concise and descriptive messages that follow the conventional commit format:

```md:commit-messages.instructions.md
## Commit Message Guidelines

- Write a clear and concise description of the code, including its purpose and functionality.
- Make sure to include any important details or context that would help someone understand the code.
- Make the commit short and descriptive, summarizing the changes made in a few words.
- Always use conventional commit message formats like "fix", "feat", or "chore".

```

## Writing

I apply these instructions when asking copilot to write blog posts, documentations, or README files:

```md:writing.instructions.md
---
applyTo: '**/*.mdx'
---

## Writing Instructions

- ALWAYS KEEPING THINGS SIMPLE!
- Use simple English, direct language, avoiding complex jargon.
- Write in spoken language, as if explaining to a friend.
- Use short sentences and paragraphs for clarity.
- Write in a friendly and approachable tone.
- Humor is welcome, but keep it appropriate (no offensive jokes or too much sarcasm).
- Use emojis to add a friendly touch, but don't overdo it.
- Titles and headings should be clear and descriptive, make theme short but enough to grab readers' curiosity.
- Make the articles human-like writing, not AI-generated.
- Ending an article with a friendly note or call to action, like "Happy coding!" or "Thanks for reading!".
```

Feel free to copy and modify these instructions to suit your own coding style and preferences.
And share with me your own instructions if you have any, I would love to learn from them!

Happy AI-training! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
