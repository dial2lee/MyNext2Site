In MacOS, have you ever encountered the issue when pressing down and holding a key on your keyboard,
then a popup will show up with a list of accented characters like this?

This is kind of annoying and might affect your typing speed.

In order to disable this behavior, you can execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

Now you will need to logout and login again for the changes to take effect. For some apps,
you might need to restart.

If you want to enable this behavior again, you can use the following command:

```bash
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
```

Happy coding! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
